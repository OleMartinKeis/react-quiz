# Project overview

This part of the react course goes through:

-   useReducer
-   Managing related pieces of State
-   Loading questions from a fake API
-   Handling loading, error and ready status
-   Setting up a timer with useEffect

As this is just a part of the Course, I will not be creating a new branch and just deploy to the main branch
